Magento-High-Speed-Import
=========================

By default, Magento only offers basic functionalities for importing products, e.g. from an ERP system, and making them available in the store. Especially with a large number of several thousand products, the standard Magento Dataflow interface is too slow. Product imports do not take between 8-20 seconds per product.

The automatic assignment of categories, image imports or even a logical import of configurable products (variant articles) with associated individual products has not been possible at all up to now with Magento on-board means.

With the Magento Import Extension developed by web-vision, you can now reliably and securely import thousands of products into your Magento store within a few minutes - for Magento 1 and Magento 2.

## Performance
Import 16,000 products into a running Magento store in live mode within 8 minutes.

## What can the MHSI do for you?
-  Graphical user interface for creating, managing import profiles and for manual execution.
-  XML to CSV conversion.
-  Import of configurable and simple products in Magento 1 or 2.
-  Import of up-selling, cross-selling and accessory products.
-  Import of special prices for customer groups (from Magento 1.7)
-  Import of graduated prices for customer groups (from Magento 1.7)
-  Import of CSV data (directly) or XML data (after previous conversion in MHSI)
-  Any number of configurable import profiles (e.g. for different data formats from different manufacturers)
-  Complete import of simple and configurable products (= variant articles with any attributes) and their assignment among each other
-  Automatic import of attribute values of any kind incl. filter or selection options
-  Import of any number of images
-  Automatic assignment of images based on the article number
-  Assignment of products to the respective categories
-  Categories can be assigned optionally by IDs and category names
-  Categories can be nested product-related
-  Automatic creation of non-existing categories in Magento 
-  Output of error messages in case of faulty import file
-  Time-controlled import via CronJob possible (e.g. for stock updates)
-  Update mode - e.g. for updating individual attributes such as names, stock quantities or sizes
